## Intro - What is the Henry Game?

  Henry is a 90's game made by Tiger Electronics that I use to have as a kid where you push the Henry button to hear a sound, and then try to find the matching sound.
When you get the correct answer the key will stay lit, and you get to go again.
You need to get four lit keys in a row to win while you are playing against the computer, or two-player mode.
Practice mode is more like blackout bingo.  You have to light up the whole board.

Here is a hilarious commercial from back in the day:

## Progress of the Game

  Currently the toggle switches are non-functional, and the game is set up for the blackout mode.
I am learning JavaScript, and not looking for any help with that part of the game at this time.
I am looking for some help with the design of the game using CSS.

## Licensing

  You are welcome to play this for fun, or take inspiration from the code to build your own things, but do know that I am just building this to learn coding, and this game should not be copied, or monetized in any way.
 Tiger Electronics owns all rights to this game.
